## Functionality

- Remove your challenge tokens from profile banner.

## Will I get banned? Is it legit?

The answer is most likely (99.99%) no. The app uses built-in functionality of the client. It does not modify anything in the client. It interacts with the client telling it to do stuff and the client does everything itself.
